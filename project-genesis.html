            <h3>About the Game</h3>
            <p>Before the journey began, our world was slowly dying. There were too many people, and not enough resources, which led to terrible wars. People stopped dreaming of going to space, stuck fighting on a ruined planet. As the danger of nuclear war grew, one brave scientist decided to take a huge risk. While the world was falling apart, he sent a small group of sleeping people and an early version of an AI into space on a fragile ship, hoping they could find a new home. Down below, the planet was destroyed by fire, giant waves, and volcanoes. Everyone on the planet died. Now, only the ship is left, floating in the dark space, and the sleeping people are waiting for the AI to figure things out. Can the AI discover the secrets of space travel in time to lead the last of humanity to a new beginning, or will they stay asleep forever?.</p>
            <p>Project Genesis is an upcoming mobile space strategy simulation focusing on exploration, deep resource management, and rebuilding civilization among the stars.</p>
